# SNHU BSBA – Course Work Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio for the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), with a concentration in International Business and a minor in Marketing.

This repository contains selected coursework, projects, presentations, and research papers that highlight my skills and academic development across a range of business subjects.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder represents a specific course and contains relevant assignments, final projects, and/or presentations (when available). This is an evolving portfolio, and I will continue to update it with new materials as they become available.

## 💼 Focus Areas

- International Business
- Marketing
- Business Leaders
- Finance & Economics
- Ethics & CSR
- Project Management

## 📌 Note

Some files may be partial due to institutional platform limitations (SNHU’s Brightspace auto-deletes content after 60 days). This is a curated collection of what I’ve retained.
